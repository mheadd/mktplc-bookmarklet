This is a simple bookmarklet that will help you push content
into the [Civic Commons Marketplace](http://marketplace.civiccommons.org).

 * Authenticate against the Mktplc API
 * Allow you to create new nodes of type Application, Organization and Interaction
 * Validate inputs against existing content, to auto-complete fields and avoid dupes.
